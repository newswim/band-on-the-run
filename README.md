## > Band On The Run

This is an attempt at a "real-world" app that's also just a breakable toy.

I wanted to try out:

- Create React App 2.0 (w/ .tsx support)
- Latest React features (_hooá¶„s_, .lazy, .memo, managed effects)
- Prisma
- Prisma client
- Node 11

> If you want to make your own project with those tools,
I would recommend use the latest CRA and Prisma, because
this will surely get out of date.
